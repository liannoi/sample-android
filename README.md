This project is one of my homework at the STEP Computer Academy on the topic of architecture. The
idea is to contact a remote data source, pick up data in JSON format from there, map it through a
converter to data types and display it on the main activity in a beautiful presentation.

The project is implemented in **MVVM architecture** in the **Kotlin** programming language, using certain
technologies (see Technologies for full details). The implementation was very exciting, if only
because I adapted the [**Google example**](https://github.com/android/architecture-samples) for my task.
I will continue to do this in the future for medium and large mobile applications for Android, since
it turned out to be a really excellent (in my opinion) example. This example uses fantastic plugins
that I saw the first time around, like ```kotlin-android```, ```kotlin-kapt```, and
```androidx.navigation.safeargs.kotlin```. These plugins generate Java classes based on fragment
bindings for ViewModels. It was also interesting to see how the activity is implemented, given its
specificity / lifecycle.

All in all, I would be happy to see something like this example, about a couple of weeks ago. All
the same, the example is very similar to the example from Google, it uses the same techniques and
practices, but at the same time - the example is a little simpler and it shows clearer edges of the
layers of the client application architecture on Android.

> The development and support of this project isn't planned, since there are still many new topics and
> subjects ahead, and, accordingly, works.
